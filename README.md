# Digit Recognizer 
This project deals with digit recognition competition available on kaggle(Digit Recognizer). The project deals recognition of digits using computer vision and convolutional neural network. Goal of this project is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images

Initial Commit: Uploading the digit recognizer prediction model codes, train dataset, test dataset, predicted dataset and other files The model was tested on the test data set and the accuracy acheived was 99.357%
